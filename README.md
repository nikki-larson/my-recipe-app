My Weekly Recipe & Grocery List Planner
This simple web application helps you and Dani quickly choose recipes for dinner on weeknights and build a comprehensive grocery list, including all the ingredients needed plus any ad-hoc items you might think of.

Every two weeks, the task of planning meals, grocery shopping, and cooking can be a time-consuming chore, often taking 30-40 minutes just for the planning phase. This app aims to drastically cut that time down to around 10 minutes, making meal prep a breeze!
