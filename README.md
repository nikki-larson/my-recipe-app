<b>My Weekly Recipe & Grocery List Planner</b>

<b>Problem to Solve</b> Dani and I alternate weeks where 1 person plans meals, grocery shops, and cooks (the other person cleans). So every 2 weeks, I end up having to spend 30-40 minutes finding recipes to make, seeing if we have the ingredients, and then making a grocery list. I wanted to get that down to 10 minutes.

<b>What is this?</b> This simple web application helps us quickly choose recipes for dinner on weeknights and build a comprehensive grocery list, including all the ingredients needed plus any ad-hoc items we need

<b>What does it do?</b> Searches for and suggests healthy recipes each week from our regular rotation of dinners, generates a categorized grocery list, and allows for customization (say we need more paper towels).



✨ <b>Features</b>
- Weekly Recipe Suggestions: Get random, healthy dinner recipe ideas for each day of the week, pulling from your curated list of favorites. Easily swap out any suggested dinner for a preferred custom recipe on any day of the week if you want to try something new
- Smart Grocery List Generation: Creates a comprehensive shopping list of all needed ingredients from your selected recipes, staples we know we need each week, and the option to add additional items (by the way, we're out of paper towels 😂). List will be categorized by store sections (Produce, Refrigerated, Pantry, Other) to streamline our shopping trip.
- Interactive Item Removal: Click to remove items from the displayed grocery list (e.g., if you already have them at home or have put them in your cart at the store).
